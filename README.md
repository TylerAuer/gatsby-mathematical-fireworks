I migrated this site to Gatsby to be able to build more interactive pages using React. You can see the [old Jekyll version of the site here](https://github.com/TylerAuer/math-tools).

# Mathematical Playgrounds

**_A growing collection of mathematical models and explorations for budding mathematicians._** I have learned a lot since I first built this.

After completing a few other projects, I am returning to this. I plan to rebuild and extend some of the current features as well as add new ones.

I recently (2/20/20) finished combining a few projects and migrating the whole site to Jekyll. This helped me be more efficient and repeat myself less. It also makes the site much easier to maintain.

## Here are the ideas bouncing around in my head

### Growing current interactives

- 100s grid
  - Blank squares to fill based on a given number of columns
  - Ability to count by _n_ instead of 1. Ex: 10, 20, 30...
  - Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Monte Carlo
  - Poker Hands
  - Blackjack
  - Roulette
  - Flipping a Coin
  - Random Walks

### New Ideas

- Ciphers and Codes
  - Cryptography & Cryptoanalysis 101
    - Alice, Bob, and Eve
    - Encipher vs Decipher (encode vs decode)
    - plaintext vs ciphertext
  - Private ciphers
    - Basic disguising techniques - All caps, clusters of 4 or five, no punctuation
    - Caeser and offset ciphers
  - Public ciphers
    - Hiding that you are even speaking in code
    - RSA
- Puzzles
  - Sums of squares in a pattern for Algebraic ideas (ex: cross)
  - 100s grid: Snapshots of grids like in many elementary math texts
  - Broken Calculators
  - RegEx Puzzles
- Tic-tac-toe Games
  - n-by-n
  - Tic-tac-grow (4-in-a-row, adding squares)
  - Ultimate
  - No starting grid
- AI playing rocks, paper, scissors with simple parameters
- Base(Radix) Conversions
- Random subitizing card generator
- Visual Collatz Conjecture
- XKCD Fruit Rating that stores users values and updates a la [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/09/upshot/game-of-thrones-chart.html)
- Powerball or other lottery simulator (try to pick a winner)
- Game of Life (Conway)
