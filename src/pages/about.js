      <p>
        As a math teacher interested in code and design I like to puzzle through
        ways to help others make sense of complex ideas. I'm working to
        strengthen my coding skills by building interactives for others to
        explore.

      <p>
        Much of what lives here is fairly old. It works, but the code isn’t
        pretty. There are too many things done inefficiently, too much repeated
        code. I didn’t know any better.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve updated a few things here and there, but the goal is really to keep
        building new things with better practices and skills.
